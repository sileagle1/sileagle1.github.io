<h1 style="text-align:center"><b>TALE 22 - Aquatic Adventures</b></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Come to our 22nd TX Annual Letterbox Event (TALE)
    as we celebrate all things aquatic. This includes anything living or taking place in water,
    such as lakes, rivers, or oceans. Though letterboxes and water donâ€™t usually mix well, hopefully
    we can celebrate being on a lake without boxes getting wet.

    Ques</a><a href="https://sileagle.webs.com/tale22" target="_blank" name="">t</a> so we have a headcount. We will
    begin by exchanging, stamping the
    event stamp, and obtaining clues. We will have a copier to print clues for
    boxes placed during the event. There will <b>NOT</b> be a potluck lunch since there is no kitchen and space is limited,
    so bring your own food and drinks. We will play TX Bingo around 06:30 pm Saturday,
    a game where you stamp a card with TX symbols carved by Baby Bear and
    hope I call them in the right order for you to win a prize. We will provide
    prizes, but voluntary donations and money for expenses are appreciated. FYI no
    pets allowed in Hall.</p>
