<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Come to our 23rd TX Annual Letterbox
    Event (TALE) as we celebrate Bring Your Own Beverage. This can be alcoholic/soft drinks or anything in between
    and was inspired by my fondness for relaxing with fellow letterboxers around a campfire. So come share your
    favorite beverage, both in a letterbox and in a cup.

    Ques</a><a href="https://sileagle.webs.com/tale23" target="_blank" name="">t</a> so we have a headcount. We will
    begin by exchanging, stamping the
    event stamp, and obtaining clues. We will have a copier to print clues for
    boxes placed during the event. A group picture will be taken before people leave to letterbox. There will be a
    potluck lunch, so bring food to share if you want to participate. We will also play TX Bingo around 06:30 pm
    Saturday, a game where you stamp a card with TX symbols carved by Baby Bear and hope I call them in the right
    order for you to win a prize. We will provide prizes, but voluntary donations and money for expenses are appreciated.
