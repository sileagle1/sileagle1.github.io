    Howdy, my name is Silver Eagle, and welcome to my Letterbox Website!
</p>
<p>
    Letterboxing is a treasure hunt (typically through parks and other scenic areas) for small boxes with
    ink stamps (usually handmade) hidden by other boxers.
<p>
    I first heard about letterboxing from an article in a magazine in the spring of 2002. I found my first letterbox on
    8/31/2002 at the Finch Arboretum in Spokane, Washington and hid my first box on 9/21/2002 at Zube Park in
    Texas. At the top you can see my current number of boxes Placed, Found, stamps eXchanged, and Events
    attended. I have placed boxes in 50 countries on all 7 continents, and in all 50 U.S. states.
